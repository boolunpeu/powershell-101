**Mission Overview:** As a computer technician at VeryEasyIT, the task was to install Windows for one of our clients. Despite being a novel assignment, confidence prevailed due to the ample resources available online. The objective was to set up a Windows system with two users: Alice as the system administrator and Bob with restricted access to his /Users/Bob folder. Additionally, the installation included configuring an antivirus and a firewall to ensure system security.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Installation of Windows 10:** Utilizing Hyper-V, the Windows 10 ISO was installed, initiating the foundation for the operating system.

3. **System Updates:** Before proceeding further, all system updates were promptly installed to ensure the latest security patches and features were integrated.
    
4. **Creation of Restricted User Account (Bob):** Following the update, a restricted user account for Bob was established. Bob's access was confined to the /Users/Bob folder, limiting his permissions to read, write, and execute files solely within this directory.
    
5. **Firewall Configuration:** Windows Firewall was activated and configured to fortify the system's defense against unauthorized access and malicious threats. This step was crucial in safeguarding both users' data and system integrity.
    
6. **Antivirus Installation:** To provide comprehensive protection against malware and other digital threats, an antivirus solution was installed and configured. This ensured real-time scanning and proactive defense mechanisms, enhancing the overall security posture of the system.
    

**Learning Objectives Achieved:**
